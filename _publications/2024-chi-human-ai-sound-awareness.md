**Abstract**  
This paper introduces a novel Human-AI collaborative framework for designing sound awareness systems tailored for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing users. By leveraging user feedback and AI-based optimizations, the proposed approach enhances accessibility and inclusivity in real-world environments.

**Key Contributions**  
- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Demonstrated how AI can support the design process in accessibility contexts.
- **Prototyping & Evaluation:** Built and tested prototypes with real users to assess usability and effectiveness.
- **Framework Development:** Outlined a replicable framework for integrating AI into accessibility design workflows.
