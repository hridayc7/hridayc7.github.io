## About Me
Hi! Welcome to my personal website! I am **Hriday Chhabria**, a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am also an HCI researcher, fortunate to be advised by [Professor "DJ" Jain](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/) at The University of Michigan, and priviligged to collaborate with [Professor Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com/) and [Anna Fang](https://annamfang.com) at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on designing, building, and evaluating human-AI systems that enhance human abilities and well-being. You can also find my work on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kT1Wm7oAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.

Outside of research, I am grateful to serve as a Teaching Assistant for [EECS 370: Introduction to Computer Organization](https://eecs370.github.io/). I love getting to meet new students and being a part of their journey through Computer Science and college in general.  

## Personal
In my spare time, I love watching and playing several different sports. I closely follow soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è, basketball üèÄ, and Cricket üèè, and I am also a Pickleball ü•í enthusiast.  Beyond sports, I also love talking tech! I used to make tech YouTube videos on my YouTube channel, [*The Tech Republic*](https://www.youtube.com/thetechrepublic), and love exploring new pieces of technology.
