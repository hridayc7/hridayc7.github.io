## About Me
Hi! Welcome to my personal website! I am **Hriday Chhabria**, a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am also an HCI researcher, fortunate to be advised by [Professor "DJ" Jain](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/) at The University of Michigan, and priviligged to collaborate with [Professor Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com/) and [Anna Fang](https://annamfang.com) at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on designing, building, and evaluating human-AI systems that enhance human abilities and well-being. At Michigan, You can explore my recent work on my [publications page](https://hridayc7.github.io/publications/).

Outside of research, I am grateful to serve as a Teaching Assistant for [EECS 370: Introduction to Computer Organization](https://eecs370.github.io/). I love getting to meet new students and being a part of their journey through Computer Science and college in general.  


In my spare time, I love watching and playing several different sports. I closely follow Chelsea F.C. in the English Premier League ⚽️, the Golden State Warriors in the NBA 🏀, and the Indian Cricket Team 🇮🇳🏏. I am also a Pickleball 🥒 enthusiast and have enjoyed playing Intramural Pickleball at The University of Michigan this past semester. Beyond sports, I also love talking tech! I used to make tech YouTube videos on my YouTube channel, [*The Tech Republic*](https://www.youtube.com/thetechrepublic), and still love having conversations about different emerging consumer technologies.
