My experiences teaching have undoubtedly been the highlight of my undergraduate experience at Michigan. I love meeting new students and watching them grow not only as students but individuals is extremely fullfing.

I have been fortunate to contribute to the learning experiences of my peers in various roles. I previously served as an M-Write Fellow for Stats 250: Introduction Statistics and Data Analysis, and a peer tutor for several introductory Computer Science Courses including Elememtary Programming Concepts and Data Structures and Algorithms.

For the last three semesters, I have served as a Teahcing Assitant for EECS 370: Introduction To Computer Organization.
