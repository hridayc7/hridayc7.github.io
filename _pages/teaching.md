At the University of Michigan, I have been fortunate enough to serve as an M-Write Fellow for Stats 250, a Peer Tutor for EECS 183, EECS 280, EECS 281 and EECS 370, and a teaching assistant for EECS 370. </br>

Serving as a Teaching Assitant has undoubtedly been the highlight of my undergraduate experience.
