## 🧪 Research Projects

### Simulus – XR + LLM based Social Simulations for Self-Care

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID_1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Simulus was a project built as part of my time doing research with Professor Haiyi Zhu, Anna Fang, and Alekhya Maram at Carnegie Mellon University. Haiyi, Anna, and Alekhya were so lovely to work with and made this summer the undoubtedly best summer of my 21 years. We built Simulus as a way for users to practice stress relief in AR/VR using the Meta Quest 3, allowing them to navigate stressful situations by conversing with ChatGPT-based virtual avatars. This also marked my first time developing in XR.

#### Key Features
* **LLM-Based Avatars**: We enabled GPT-4o-based avatars in our system, creating personas with different identities and conversational styles.
* **Contextual Memory**: Our system builds on previous conversations to enhance realism and immersion over time.
* **Speech-to-Text Integration**: To allow users to directly interact with avatars using just their voice, we integrated OpenAI's Whisper STT API.

## 🚀 Personal Projects

### EverArc – A Simple Habit Tracker for iOS (Personal Project)

Over the years, I have tried many different Habit Tracker apps, but I was never able to consistently log habits over a long period of time. I wanted to use a simple, yet effective app that reduced setup friction while also delivering visually crafty ways of showing me my progress. This led to the development of EverArc! Try out the beta version for free on TestFlight!

#### Key Features
* **Quick, One-Tap Habit Tracking**: Complete your daily habits with a single tap, with automatic streak calculation to keep your motivation high.
* **Visual Progress System**: Color-coded progress rings and calendar heatmaps make it easy to see your consistency at a glance, with celebratory animations when you complete all habits.
* **Minimalist, Focused UI**: No unnecessary settings or overwhelming options—just the essential features you need to build better habits consistently.
