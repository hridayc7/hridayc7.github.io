## EverArc - A Simple Habit Tracker for iOS

![Project 1 Demo](/images/portfolio/project1.gif)

Over the years, I have tried many different Habit Tracker apps, however, I have never been able to consistently log habits over a long period of time in a single app. I wanted to use a simple, yet effective app that reduced the amount of time it took me to get setup with Habit Tracking, while also delivering visually crafty ways of showing me my progress over time. This led to the development of EverArc! Try out the beta version for free on TestFlight!

### Key Features
* **Quick, One-Tap Habit Tracking**: Complete your daily habits with a single tap, with automatic streak calculation to keep your motivation high
* **Visual Progress System**: Color-coded progress rings and calendar heatmaps make it easy to see your consistency at a glance, with celebratory animations when you complete all habits
* **Minimalist, Focused UI**: No unnecessary settings or overwhelming optionsâ€”just the essential features you need to build better habits consistently
